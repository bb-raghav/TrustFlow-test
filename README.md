# TrustFlow

TrustFlow helps clients and freelancers coordinate milestone terms, evidence, AI assisted review, human approval, and PayPal payments. It is a prototype: AI reports findings, while only the authenticated project client can approve a milestone. TrustFlow does not provide legal escrow.

## How the workflow works

1. A client creates a project and invites a freelancer by email. A new freelancer can create an account from the invitation link; the invitation is attached after email verification when verification is enabled.
2. The freelancer accepts or declines the invitation. The client proposes milestone criteria, amount, currency, and deadline; the freelancer accepts each milestone's terms or requests changes before work starts.
3. The freelancer submits a revision with text, HTTP(S) reference links, and optionally a private file (up to 3 MB). No PayPal account connection is required from the freelancer for the demo checkout.
4. The client asks Gemini to assess the current revision against the agreed criteria. The report is stored with criterion-level findings and an audit record.
5. The client requests changes or explicitly approves the current revision.
6. A client approves a standard PayPal Sandbox order, TrustFlow records the authorization, and the client captures it after explicit milestone approval. Captured funds are processed by the PayPal merchant account configured for the app; this demo does not pay funds out to freelancers.

Assessment considers only the submitted text. Reference links are not opened. PDF, image, and text attachments are stored as private PostgreSQL binary data and can be downloaded by project members, but file contents are not extracted or assessed. Reports disclose this limitation.

## Local setup

Use Python 3.10 or newer and Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+.

Create the root virtual environment and install backend dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

Create `backend/.env` from `backend/.env.example` only if it does not already exist. Add your PostgreSQL URL. To use assessments, set `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `TRUSTFLOW_MODEL`. For standard PayPal Sandbox checkout, configure the Sandbox `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`; no Marketplace partner credentials or freelancer onboarding are needed. Never commit `.env` or copy its values into the example file.

Apply the base schema and all additive migrations explicitly:

```bash
cd backend
../venv/bin/python scripts/setup_db.py
```

Start the API from `backend/`:

```bash
../venv/bin/python -m app.main
```

It listens on port 3000 by default. `GET http://localhost:3000/health` is public; readiness and product data require a session. The database schema and migrations are not applied automatically at app startup.

In a second terminal, start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Vite serves the app at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/api` to the local backend. Create a client account and invite any freelancer email. The freelancer can sign up from the invitation email, verify the same address if required, accept the project and milestone terms, then submit work. No freelancer PayPal connection step is part of this demo.

## Environment variables

`backend/.env.example` lists every setting. Main settings:

- `DATABASE_URL` — PostgreSQL connection string.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `TRUSTFLOW_MODEL`, optional `TRUSTFLOW_FALLBACK_MODEL` — AI assessment provider.
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, optional `PAYPAL_BASE_URL` — PayPal; Sandbox is the default.
- `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID` — registered webhook ID required for signature verification.
- `PAYPAL_RETURN_URL`, `PAYPAL_CANCEL_URL` — frontend callback pages.
- `CORS_ORIGINS` — exact frontend origins, comma separated.
- `TRUSTFLOW_ENV` — set to `production` when deployed; this enables Secure session cookies.
- `SESSION_HASH_SALT` — generate a unique random value for production.
- `TRUSTFLOW_FRONTEND_URL` — public frontend origin used for verification, invitation emails, and authenticated milestone links. Set this in deployed environments.
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL`, `SMTP_FROM_NAME`, `SMTP_USE_SSL`, `SMTP_USE_STARTTLS` — SMTP delivery for signup verification, password reset, invitations, milestone updates, evidence reviews, decisions, and payment notifications. `SMTP_FROM_NAME` controls the sender label shown to recipients and defaults to `TrustFlow`. Set provider credentials on the backend only; never commit them.
- `ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL` — optional server-only Catch Hook for non-email workflow and verified refund automations. Events are transactionally placed in the PostgreSQL outbox and retried. User-facing email is always composed and sent by backend SMTP; recipient addresses are removed from the Zapier copy of email events. See [the Zapier guide](docs/REFUNDS_AND_ZAPIER.md).
- `TRUSTFLOW_AGENT_TOKEN` — bearer token required for the agent refund-proposal intake endpoint.
- `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL`, optional `ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN` — optional monitoring.

## Vercel services deployment

The production frontend is `https://trustflow-paypal.vercel.app`; the root `vercel.json` keeps `/api/*` on the existing Vercel backend service, so browser authentication stays same-origin. Set the backend's `TRUSTFLOW_ENV=production`, `CORS_ORIGINS` to the exact frontend origin, and `TRUSTFLOW_FRONTEND_URL`, `PAYPAL_RETURN_URL`, and `PAYPAL_CANCEL_URL` to the Vercel frontend. The Render blueprint retains its existing backend URL and frontend service, with explicit origins for both deployed frontends. The session cookie stays host-only, HttpOnly, Secure in deployed environments, and SameSite=Lax; CSRF token and Origin checks stay enabled. Existing PayPal credentials and Sandbox endpoint are unchanged.

Apply the database schema and migrations to the Vercel database before using the app. Evidence files up to 3 MB are stored in PostgreSQL so they remain available across serverless function instances. This increases database storage use; larger files should use an external object store.

The app prefers Argon2id through `argon2-cffi`. The existing offline development environment can fall back to Python’s scrypt implementation if that package cannot be installed. Deployed installs should install `backend/requirements.txt` so account passwords use Argon2id.

## API overview

- `POST /auth/verify-email`, `POST /auth/resend-verification`, `POST /auth/password-reset/request`, `POST /auth/password-reset/confirm`
- `GET /projects`, `POST /projects`, `GET /projects/{id}`, `POST /projects/{id}/accept`, `POST /projects/{id}/decline`, `POST /projects/{id}/invitation/cancel`, `POST /projects/{id}/invitation/resend`, `GET /projects/{id}/audit`
- `POST /projects/{id}/milestones`, `PUT /projects/{id}/milestones/{milestone_id}`

- `GET /health`, `GET /agent/health`, authenticated `GET /ready`

The same backend routes are also mounted under `/api` for the Vercel public API rewrite. Unprefixed paths remain available for local development and the existing Render deployment.

Cookie-authenticated mutations require the `X-CSRF-Token` returned by login or `/auth/me`. The browser stores the session in an HttpOnly cookie. A client can request approval only with a current successful assessment where every criterion is met. Capture verifies the persisted client decision, evidence revision, assessment report, payment state, and PayPal authorization. A caller-supplied approval flag is not used.

Agent refund proposals appear in the client payment dashboard and require an explicit client decision before PayPal receives a refund request. Configure PayPal's `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.REFUNDED` event and a Zapier Catch Hook to automate ticket resolution. Setup steps and the agent proposal payload are in [the refund and Zapier guide](docs/REFUNDS_AND_ZAPIER.md).

Zapier also receives invitation, milestone-agreement, evidence-submitted, assessment-completed, revision-requested, milestone-approved, and confirmed-payment-captured notifications. Event creation is server-side and transactional; delivery uses the existing retryable outbox. Configure a scheduled outbox worker in deployments without the Render cron service.

The old unscoped `/assessments`, `/agent/assess`, and `/paypal/*` payment routes are not registered by the application. Use the milestone-scoped authenticated endpoints above.

## Tests and checks

Run backend tests from `backend/`:

```bash
../venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Run frontend checks from `frontend/`:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Backend tests mock Gemini and PayPal calls. They do not apply database migrations or contact PostgreSQL, Gemini, PayPal, or Zapier. Browser automation lives in `e2e/`; follow its README to configure dedicated test accounts and run the suite against a local or approved non-production environment. Browser workflows create application data, and optional tests contact Gemini and PayPal Sandbox.

## Known MVP limits

- Signup verification, password resets, invitations, milestone activity, review decisions, and payment notifications are sent through backend SMTP with TrustFlow-written event-specific messages. Local development signup remains immediate when SMTP is not configured; production signup is blocked until SMTP is configured. Zapier remains optional for non-email workflow and refund automations and is no longer used to send user emails.
- Standard PayPal checkout requires a merchant account associated with the configured PayPal REST app credentials. Captures are processed by that merchant account; the demo has no freelancer payout or split-settlement feature.
- Rows already present in the legacy `users` table may not have a password hash. Those users should use **Forgot password** with the account email to set a password through the verified email reset flow.
- Uploaded files (up to 3 MB) are stored privately in PostgreSQL and downloadable by project members, but are not extracted, scanned for malware, OCRed, or included in the Gemini prompt. Do not treat file-only evidence as verified.
- Evidence links are recorded and checked for valid HTTP(S) shape, but never fetched.
- An uncertain capture remains `capture_pending`; the backend will not issue another capture. Reconcile through the verified webhook or the authenticated PayPal order check. A mismatch requires operator review.
- An expired PayPal authorization is blocked from capture. Replacing an expired authorization currently requires operator intervention.
- Webhook verification needs a registered PayPal webhook and `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`. No live PayPal request has been made by the automated suite.
- The Render blueprint uses a persistent disk for evidence and describes Sandbox settings. Configure environment secrets, run the schema script, and review costs before creating services. No deployment is performed automatically.
- User and payment operations require a reachable PostgreSQL database. This workspace’s configured Neon host could not be resolved during the earlier migration audit, so live database behavior remains unverified.
